Hi, my name is Tanguy Marsaut and welcome to my website. I've developped this
website using the project
[academicpages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) mostly
to get a grasp on the ins and outs of setting up an academic website, but also
to be able to talk a bit about my research, my projects, and the other various
topics I fancy or might fancy in the future. 

Academic interests
======
I'm a physics student in Quantum Technology at CentraleSup√©lec, Paris, France.
I'm passionate of quantum physics in general and that's why I've chosen to
follow down the path of quantum technologies. This year I'll be mostly studying
condensed matter physics with applications on semiconductors, supraconductors
and more involved quantum technologies. I will also be attending classes on more
fundamental topics like cosmology, quantum field theory, particle physics and
topics at the border between mathematics and physics. 

Although I'm following MSc in Quantum Technologies, that is to say applied physics, I'm more
interested in theoretical and mathematical physics. I'm really keen on learning
about our fundamental understanding of the Universe and I decided to teach
myself quantum field theory, general relativity and a bit of string theory using
the various available resources online (I could never thank Pr. David Tong
enough).
